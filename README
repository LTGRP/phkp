WARNING: THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT PRODUCTION-READY. IT PROBABLY CONTAINS
BUGS AND SECURITY LEAKS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!

INSTALL:
- Copy the phkp.php script to your webserver directory. If you can put it
  in the root directory of your web dir, you can rename it to 'index.php'.
  If you don't do this, you will need to redirect every request to /pks
  to this script. For example, using Apache rewrite rules:
		RewriteRule ^/pks/(.*)   /phkp.php?/pks/$1
- Modify the values in index.php to reflect your settings and create the
  necessary directories

USING:
- Simply point your gpg to the right keyserver and port. For example:
	gpg --keyserver hkp://example.com:80 --search-keys Remko
	gpg --keyserver hkp://example.com:80 --send-keys 8E041080
	gpg --keyserver hkp://example.com:80 --recv-keys 8E041080
	
KNOWN ISSUES:
- Expiration and revocation is only detected with the english version
  of GnuPG. Other languages will omit this information.

TODO: 
- Provide more information for uids in searches
- Return human readable output if 'mr' option is not set
- Make more robust, fool proof and secure
- Better logging
- More graceful calls to GnuPG
- Fine-tune GnuPG options (try to avoid creation of trustdb etc. if possible)
- Look at expiration date computation. Currently has a workaround to avoid
  being one day off.
